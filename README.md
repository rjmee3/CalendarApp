# Calendar Web Application
*(THIS REPO IS A PLACEHOLDER FOR NOW)*

### Introduction
For a side project, I want to develop a lightweight calendar/planner app.

My goals for this project are as follows:
1. UI Design:
   - design an intuitive interface
   - focus will be on desktop, but could branch to mobile

2. Basic Calendar Functionality:
   - implement the ability to view different timescales,
     such as days, weeks, months
   - users should be allowed to add events and appointments
   - implement checklists that can be added for each day

3. Database Design:
   - set up secure, lightweight storage method for storing
     events, calendars, and users data

4. User Authentication:
   - implement user authentication to allow for signup and
     login of users so calendar data is safe behind some
     combo of username/password/3rd party auth

5. Search Functionality:
   - a user should be able to search for events/appointments
     they have scheduled

6. Performance Optimization:
   - app should be optimized for performance when handling
     large numbers of events

7. Import/Export:
   - app should be able to import data from and export data
     to other calendar apps

8. Security:
   - User's credentials and calendar data should be protected
     to prevent unauthorized access

8. Documentation:
   - comprehensive documentation for all parts of the app
     to be able to understand all parts if I return to
     project at a future date

9. Testing:
   - Develop thorough test strategies to ensure app quality,
     such as unit testing, integration testing, etc.
